            <h2>Hey guys,</h2>
            <p>This week we’ll be discussing the concept of <b>"Youtubability" -</b><br />
                another important game guideline.

                <h3>Youtubability</h3>
                <p> A key driver of youtubability is the <b>clarity <br />
                    of your gameplay</b> to a potential player. <br />
                    <br />
                    Gameplay clarity will help you achieve the <br />
                    full potential of your game by working on <br />
                    getting<b> the lowest possible CPIs </b> for your <br />
                    games.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Many elements can be used to make your <br />
                    game clearer: <br />
                    For instance, ask yourself if a user’s inte- <br />
                    raction with the game is <b>evident</b>, for <br />
                    example, can she tell which character she <br />
                    <b>controls?</b> Is the <b>objective clear?</b> Does it <br />
                    look <b>fun to play?</b> Has she understood the <br />
                    game after 1 second (great!) or after 10 <br />
                    seconds (too long!).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Make sure to <b>use colours</b> to help indicate <br />
                    the gameplay rules. For instance, in Helix <br />
                    Jump, obstacles are <b>clearly contrasted</b> (in <br />
                    orange here) and instantly recognized as <br />
                    a threat.

                <p> If you want to run user tests with <br />
                    friends and family or even random <br />
                    people in the street, it is interesting to <br />
                    show them the 30 second video before <br />
                    making them try to prototype in order <br />
                    to <b>understand their</b> expectations from <br />
                    the video vs. the actual game they try. <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b> Make it obvious </b> with visual elements <br />
                    that help <b>understand the objective and <br />
                    controls </b> of the game, like with the <br />
                    target used in Viatcheslav Tarasov’s <br />
                    Purple Diver or Fabrika Games’ Draw <br /> Car with the
                    space dedicated to <br />
                    drawing.

            <p> People will be watching the gameplay videos of your games <b>on their <br />
                phone’s Facebook feed</b>, everything will seem smaller than when <br />
                displayed in Unity or as a video on your computer screen. <b>You should <br />
                also consider whether your gameplay video is understandable if <br />
                someone watches it on a small screen </b>. With an average watch time of 3 <br />
                to 5 seconds, this is an <b>accelerated elevator pitch!</b>
                <br />
                <br />
                Think of the moment when you decide to click on a random video <br />
                on YouTube just because it has an attractive thumbnail - it’s the same idea <br />
                for your game videos.
